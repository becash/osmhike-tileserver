<H2>Hiking oriented Tile Server</H2>

<P>
Osmhike is a Linux/Docker based implementation of an Openstreetmap Tile Server. It uses Openstreetmap data.
<BR>It is derived from Cyclosm.
<P>Three goals:
<LI>Allow to build a personnal tile-server, for producing maps adapted to mountain hiking, (without loosing too much bike information)
<LI>Provide a full beginner's tutorial ( the one I would have liked to have at the beginning of the project )
<LI>Implement contours and hillshade, which are missing in Openstreetmap
